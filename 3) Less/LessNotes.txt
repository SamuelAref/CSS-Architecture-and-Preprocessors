
Installing Less 

    npm install  -g less 

    // install less watch for watching the less file 

    npm install -g less-watch-compiler 

create a less file 

        styles.less 

            body{

                background:red;
            }

        // even if we include this file in our html, it won't show 
           since it is not  a css file, so we need to compile it down 
           with what we installed 

Compiling less file 

    lessc styles.less  // this will just return the compiled text 
    less styles.less styles.css // this will compile it to a new file styles.css 

Declaring variable 

        @background-color : #red ; // this is a variable 

Watching Less

        less-watch-compiler less css  // this means watch the less folder for any change and compile it into the css folder css file 

        to avoid always writing the directories, we created a new file less-watch-compiler.config.json  and posted our rules there 

            less-watch-compiler.config.json

                {

                    "allowedExtensions": [".less"],
                    "minified": false,
                    "sourceMap": false,
                    "watchFolder": "less",
                    "outputFolder": "css"
                }

            then we can run command without directories like less-watch-compiler

Properties of less 

        variables - @variableName : value;
        extends - .classOne:extend(.classTwo){

                        properties here
                    }
        mixins - .mixin-borderRadius(@radius){

                        border-radius: @radius;
                    } // so we can use this mixin anywhere 
        Nesting - li{

                        padding:10px 0;

                        a{

                            color: red;
                            &:hover {

                                color: black;  
                            }
                        }

                    
                    }
